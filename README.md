# Memorizing-Power-Game-by-Python
In this project I have made a Memorization game and named it as 'Memorization Power'. Main file is named as 'MemorizingPowerGame.py'.
## About The Game:
- The main interface of the window contains 4x4 grids where each grid contains an unique picture which is hidden from you.
- There are 2 same images in the grid.
- When you click on one grid then it will show you the image which is hidden under it.
- You can see atmost 2 images at the same time. So when you clicked on the third image, the first image you have clicked, will become hidden again!!!
- So, you have to memorize the pictures under the hidden grids.
- When two recent clicked images get matched, then you will be shown a 'It's Match!' screen.
- There also a 'SEE PROFILE' button at the bottom of the game screen.
- If you first time open the game, then it will say you to complete the full game first, then it will show you your records.
- After that, wheneven you will perform well the best performance will be stored!!!
